We will have 500 tagged trout which varies in range from $20 to $5,000.

<div class="status-box info">Due to the complex issues we are facing this year
with continued challenges of the COVID-19 virus we will not have a formal derby
headquarters we all enjoy.</div>

We are in the process of designing a virtual format to accommodate as many as
possible to submit your catch via text or email, watch for the derby rules as
we are writing them as quickly as possible.

With that said we have had to reduce a number of the items all of us with the
derby committee have come to enjoy year after year.  This year we have had to
remove the three divisions this year Men, Women & Youth along for longest fish
as well as our entertaining daily blind boogie drawing and the fish net raffle. 

We will have the Isabella Lake Derby hats available but we do not have the
T-Shirts which so many collect to remember the event bye.

One other major announcement...a big one. There are always great raffle prizes
given away each year at Derby Headquarters, this year is no exception, but we
are upping our game! As of now we are officially announcing that thanks to the
efforts of the Kern River Lake Isabella Chamber of Commerce and Galeys Marine
in Bakersfield, CA. we have a unbelievable item for our anglers.

**First Grand Prize Drawing** will be a 2020 BassTracker Classic XL, 50HP
Mercury Marine Low emission outboard, Minn Kota Trolling Motor, Lowrance Hook-3x
color fish finder, dual batteries, live well and a diamond coat tracker trailer.
All I can say is WOW!

**Second Grand Prize Drawing** will be a Honda Eu2200i, 2200 watt Honda
Generator. Need I say anymore .  AWESOME UNIT!!!!!!

**Third Grand Prize Drawing** // CASH  Yes CASH // We will have two separate
drawings for $500 cash on each one.

We are working on additional items with the changes we are following this year
to hold this great event.

Make sure to grab a few drawing tickets for these great prizes.  Your donations
for tickets go to towards the future derby events and can be obtained a the
Chamber of Commerce or at various locations in the Lake Isabella Area. 

Make a note, we will NOT have a large Derby Headquarters this year.  You can
stop by the Kern River Valley Chamber of Commerce, located at 6416 Lake Isabella
Blvd, right in the center of town, just make a left at the four-way stop coming
off of Highway 178 and go about a quarter of a mile and it is on the right hand
side.

Please sign up <a href="{{ page.eventURL }}" rel="noopener noreferrer external">ONLINE {% include common/icon.html icon="link-external" height="18" width="18" fill="currentColor" %}</a>:
We need to keep this as virtual as possible to comply with the Covid guidelines.
Print your online order and use this as your registration number, more
information to follow soon.
